# I Don't Know What I'm Doing: My AI-Generated Fitness Experiment

I'm overwhelmed with my current life schedule and some internal mental conditions.

I'm getting fat only on my belly.

I felt that I don't have enough time, but in reality I might have it. My "busy" day comes from my overthinking and some uneccessary anxieties that I need to recover from.

Somewhat desperate, I turn to Claude (Sonnet 4) to ask things, I elaborated my full conditions and ask him to help me to build habit to fix my fitness.
I don't know if this is correct or not, but I'll post it so I can access this anywhere without having to open my laptop or searching for a file somewhere in my phone.

Feel free to follow or correct me, but I'll try to do this anyway. At least to built consistency.

## Claude's Conclusion

**The Stress-Cortisol-Weight Gain Cycle**:
When you're chronically stressed (work anxiety, sleep disruption, guilt), your body produces excess cortisol. This hormone literally tells your body to store fat around your midsection as "emergency fuel." It also increases cravings for carbs and disrupts sleep, creating a vicious cycle: stress → cortisol → belly fat + poor sleep → more stress.

### Important Notes:

#### Form Over Speed

- Quality movements are better than fast, sloppy ones
- If you can't maintain good form, reduce reps or take longer rest

#### Progression Tracking

- Week 1: Focus on learning movements
- Week 2: Focus on consistency
- Week 3: Add intensity (more reps/longer holds)
- Week 4: Push your limits while maintaining form

#### Listen to Your Body

- Sore muscles = normal
- Sharp pain = stop immediately
- Extremely tired = take extra rest day
- Baby had rough night = lighter workout or skip

#### Equipment Substitutions

- No space for lying exercises? Do standing variations
- Can't do push-ups? Start with wall push-ups
- 5kg too heavy? Start with 1 dumbbell or bodyweight only

#### Time Management

- Whole routine should take 25-30 minutes
- If rushed, do 1 circuit instead of 2-3
- Something is better than nothing

#### After Week 4

- Assess progress and adjust
- Consider adding resistance bands or heavier weights
- Increase workout duration or frequency based on results
