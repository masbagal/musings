# Choosing This Anyway

There is a theory that says your life runs on four burners: family, friendship, health, and work. The idea is simple: You cannot run all four at full heat at the same time and some of it always turns down or neglected.

I became a father in 2024. I made a choice: I would not delegate my child to someone else. No babysitter, no full-time daycare, no handing off to relatives while my wife and I both disappeared into our careers. We are doing it ourselves.

I work remotely, which sounds like the ideal setup for this. **Spoiler: it's not**.

There is nothing ideal about trying to debug a production issue while your child is crying in the next room, or handing off parenting duty at 6 pm when your work is only half done, or pushing through until midnight to finish something that should have taken a few hours. I still get my work done, but I have quietly turned down the burners on my health and my friendships to keep both family and work burning at all.

There are days I look at people moving faster than me. Some are building businesses, some are doing things I keep telling myself I'll get to eventually. In tech, standing still can feel like falling behind. I don't know if the choice I'm making is wise or just the only one I know how to make.

A former employer once told me that I should focus on work and delegate everything else. The child could be handled by my wife, one of our mothers, or a hired babysitter. He mentioned my salary was enough to afford it based on the rate of my current city. I nodded and then rejected that politely. Not anger comes out from that opinion but the advice itself revealed something: we were measuring things differently. I don't think he was wrong, exactly. We just had different definitions of normal and had different prioritization.

I had this thought of doing it with the said advice though. _What if I just did it? Turn off the family burner for a few years, grind harder, earn more._ With enough money I could give my child everything I'm currently too tired to think about: the best schools, the baby classes, the extra curricular activities (piano? ballet? or all kinds of prestigious activities to make them busy and keeping away from my work while preparing them to be some kind of prodigy), the opportunities. My love will be expressed not in hours but in what those hours bought, the kids will thank me in the future (really?). Is that worse? **I genuinely don't know.**

The scary part is it's not a crazy idea. It's what a lot of smart, loving parents do and their kids turn out fine, sometimes even better. There will be doors open for them that my child may have to knock on harder.

**So what, then, is the point of parental presence which I have been doing?**

The answer I keep coming back to is not about success or opportunity. **It's about values.** How they get passed on before a child even knows they're learning anything.

There's a quote I can't fully remember, something about not being a drop in the ocean but the whole ocean inside a drop. I don't know who wrote it or if I even have the words right. But the idea stays with me. Something being whole rather than large. A life doesn't become less just because no grand achievement is earned. (edit: found it. It's Jalaludin Rumi)

That's what I'm trying to pass on. A life measured in relationships, in small genuine impacts, in being known and knowing others. I absorbed this from my family somewhere early, not through education or any particular success and I don't know how to transfer it through a bank account or arrange it through the right institutions. This does not mean money is bad, but because I think these values are caught, not taught. Children will absorb them from being around someone who lives them.

That might be naive. I had another debate about it with friends who live in a more competitive city than my hometown and they have their own truth to it that I admit but can't apply. Maybe I am preparing my child for a world that no longer quite exists. Maybe I'm just old-school, holding on to something because letting go of it feels like losing myself.

But I keep choosing this anyway.

I don't write this to say that delegation is wrong or that ambition is the enemy of parenthood. These questions linger and I needed to put them somewhere, name the thing, sit with it, and keep going.
