# Choosing This Anyway

There is a theory that says your life runs on four burners: family, friendship, health, and work. The idea is simple and brutal. You cannot run all four at full heat at the same time and some of it always turns down.

I became a father in 2024. I made a choice: I would not delegate my child to someone else. No babysitter, no full-time daycare, no handing off to relatives while my wife and I both disappeared into our careers. We are doing it ourselves.

I work remotely, which sounds like the ideal setup for this. **Spoiler: It's not**. There is nothing ideal about trying to debug production issue while your child is crying in the next room, or handing off parenting duty at 5pm when your work is only half done, or pushing through until midnight to finish something that should have taken a few hours. I still get my work done, but I have quietly turned down the burners on my health and my friendships to keep both family and work burning at all.

I am not fully accepting this situation. There are days I look at people moving faster than me. Some are building businesses, some of them are doing things I keep telling myself I'll get to eventually. In tech especially, standing still can feel like falling behind. I don't know if the choice I'm making is wise or just the only one I know how to make.

A former employer once told me, during a moment of frustration that as not really about me, that I should focus on work and delegate everything else. The child could be handled by my wife, one of our mothers, or just hire a babysitter. He mentioned that my salary was enough to afford it. I nodded and then decided to end the conversation. Not out of anger from this opinion but because the advice itself revealed something: we were measuring things differently. I don't think he was wrong, exactly. **We just had different definitions of normal and have different burners prioritization.**

I watched people with far more resources than me raise children fully delegated, rich resourced, surrounded by the best education or facilities money can access. Those children will probably succeed. They will have opportunities I cannot give my child. Doors will open for them that my child may have to knock on harder. I'm not writing this with bitterness, I write it because I think it's true.

**So what, then, is the point of presence?** This "presence" thing that most people try to form opinion with: 'they are rich, but they are not present for their kids'.

The answer I keep coming back to is not about success. It's about what gets internalized before a child even knows they're learning anything. The way they learn to measure their own worth. The things they come to believe, without being told, about what a good life looks like.

There's a quote I can't fully remember, something about _not being a drop in the ocean but the whole ocean inside a drop_. I don't know who wrote it or if I even have the words right but the idea stays with me. Something being whole rather than large.

My own sense of what matters is that a life is measured in relationships, in small genuine impacts, in being known and knowing others. I am pretty sure I did not arrive at this through education or success. I absorbed it somewhere early in my childhood. I believe presence is how values are transmitted before language is complex enough to explain it.

That might be naive. I had another debate about it with my friends who lived in a more competitive area than my hometown and they have their own truth to it that I admit but I can't apply. Maybe I am preparing them for a world that no longer quite exists. Maybe I'm just a stubborn who's holding on to something old because letting go of it feels like losing myself.

But I keep choosing this anyway.

I don't write this to argue that delegation is wrong or that ambition is a betrayal of parenthood. I write it because I tried to pour my lingering thoughts.

I don't have clean answers. I don't know if the trade I'm making is wise or just the only option I know how to make. Maybe both.
