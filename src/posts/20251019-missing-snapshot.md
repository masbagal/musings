# Missing Snapshot

Laziness combined with busy days strikes again, and I didn't write anything.

I did have some ideas to write last month, but I kept delaying and not noting them down. I keep telling myself that I don't have the time because there's a big urgent project at work, but just jotting down two or three sentences should work, so that's not an excuse.

By the time I wanted to write it down (which is now), it felt irrelevant. The feelings that I wanted to pour out are no more. While this seems like a trivial problem, I'm somewhat sad because of something I did a few days ago: reading my past notes stored only on my phone.

In those notes, I wrote down what I felt, what I found, and what I learned. Many of them were too private or too emotional, so they stay there. While reading them, I got a glimpse of what I felt that day when I wrote them. They're a snapshot of my own thoughts. I might not have the same thoughts today, but I had them before. I relived the moments when I wrote those notes.

They were snapshots of my life, and I missed taking some snapshots of my precious moments last month.

I should capture them more. Maybe you should too? It's embarrassing or it might be a bad, but that's fine since you don't have to share it with the world.
