# Thomas: A Plot Device in the Form of Doubt

_ℹ️ Note: Biblical reference ahead, but this is about storytelling technique, not theology._

In nearly every sermon, Thomas the Apostle becomes the butt of jokes. "Poor Thomas," they say, "he didn't believe Jesus had risen." But after reconsidering the story, Thomas's doubt was actually essential to spreading the Gospel narrative.

## The Credibility Problem

Imagine if news suddenly spread that someone who had recently died was actually alive again. This news comes from the deceased person's closest followers and people known for practically worshipping him. As an outsider, would you believe it?

The natural response would be skepticism:

> "Oh please, of course they'd make up that story."
>
> "It's just Jesus's gang trying to make him look miraculous."

After all, who would want to listen to stories from followers of a criminal who had just been executed?

## Enter Thomas: The Strategic Doubter

This is where Thomas becomes crucial. Here's one of Jesus's own disciple (or a _"gang member"_, a _"cult member"_, an _"inner circle friend"_, or whatever people might perceive him) publicly declaring his disbelief. If even Jesus's closest companion didn't believe, surely the general public who already skeptical about the resurrection news would feel validated in their doubt.

> "See? Even your homie Thomas doesn't believe it. You're all just making things up."

## The Turning Point

Then Jesus appears before Thomas. Thomas believes and publicly changes his stance.

Now the people who had agreed with Thomas's skepticism begin to question their own doubt. Some start to believe:

> "Why did someone who didn't believe suddenly change his mind?"
>
> "Did Jesus really rise and visit Thomas?"
>
> "Maybe there's actually truth to this story?"

Not everyone will have that thought, but any number of "user acquisition" helps.

## The Narrative Function

Who knows whether this was part of God's own plot device or John's literary craftsmanship in his Gospel? Thomas serves as a crucial narrative element that made the story more believable to people of that era, which is why it was recorded. Would John really write about his friend's shortcomings without purpose?

Thomas represents the skeptic in all of us. His doubt mirrors what any reasonable person would feel, making his eventual belief all the more believable. In storytelling terms, he's the perfect vehicle for addressing the audience's natural skepticism.

Once again, who really knows the full truth? But it's pretty clever storytelling either way.
