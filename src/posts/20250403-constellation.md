# Rediscovering Wonder Beneath the Stars

As a child, I was fascinated by constellations and how ancient people could see shapes in the lines they drew between stars, especially mythological forms. Over time, however, my interest waned as questions and doubts crept in:

- Could these star patterns really be identified without confusion?
- How did people decide which stars to connect with lines?
- How could they avoid mistakenly drawing lines between adjacent constellations?
- Were people just making things up?
- I couldn't see all the points shown in picturesâ€”maybe only special people with special equipment could truly see them.

I never dismissed the truth or existence of constellations, but as I grew older, I became increasingly skeptical. As an adult, my mind was occupied solely with life's responsibilities. "Unimportant" things like this had no place in my head.

Last Monday, my day was filled with unclear emotions. I felt utterly stifled. That evening, I carried my baby daughter outside to get some fresh air. While gazing at the sky, I looked up at the stars and suddenly saw a clear, familiar shape: **four nearby stars that, when connected, formed a cross or kite.**

From my buried memories, I recognized this pattern as the ["Southern Cross"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux), a cross often used to indicate south.

To confirm this further, I downloaded the Star Tracker app on my phone. I pointed the camera at the constellation I was seeing, and indeed, what I observed with the naked eye was truly the constellation I remembered.

This might seem ordinary to others, but in that moment, a surge of joy bubbled up from within my heart. "Finally, I can see and recognize a constellation that until now only existed in media," I thought. All my childhood feelings of wonder about outer space came flooding back.

For a moment, I forgot that I was a grown man responsible for many things and felt like a child again. How many extraordinary things exist beyond the rigid, boring daily life of adults.

My heart was moved to explore more, and I directed the Star Tracker app to other parts of the sky. I saw _Canis Major_, though not all its points were visible, but I could identify _Sirius_ within this constellation. I spotted _Canopus_ to the right of the Southern Cross. I learned for the first time that the Southern Cross is actually contained within the _Centaurus_ constellation. So much curiosity about the cosmos returned that I felt like buying a telescope.

In the end, this serves as a reminder that I sometimes need to look at other aspects of life. Just as someone working in front of a monitor needs to rest their eyes by looking at something else, so too with life. We occasionally need to shift our gaze away from daily routines and suffocating problems to refresh our minds.
