# I Wasn't Ready for a Stepfather, But Here We Are

**Long story short: my father passed away and my mother remarried. So I gained a stepfather.**

I don't want to write about all the drama that occurred during the process, but to summarize things, the process up to my mother's remarriage felt uncomfortable for us. Many things made us feel uneasy, though the wedding ultimately took place anyway.

### Facing the New Reality

From the beginning, I set clear boundaries with my mother's prospective husband.

> "Sir, I'm sorry but I'm not ready to call you Father or Dad yet. Perhaps it's because I'm already grown up and have my own family. It might be a different story if this had all happened when I was still in school."

He accepted this. As time went on, I admitted that he is a kind person and admitting that the unpleasant process that occurred at the beginning wasn't entirely his fault (While he also had a part of it, there was another person that had a bigger role in this big dumpster fire).

Until this day I still call him _"Om"_, which translates to "Uncle".

### The Process of Accepting and Letting Go

Many relatives and friends asked how I was finally able to set aside my emotions and accept the situation. It wasn't easy. However, after much thoughts and enough time has passed, these are the things I should go with:

**First, constantly being angry and harboring hatred is exhausting**. What's done is done. What else can we do? It's better to focus on the present situation and how to make it better.

**Second, I don't want to pass down hatred to my child.** My child should see the world through their own eyes and feelings. I don't want them to hate something just because I do, without clearly understanding the reasons.

**Third, he loves my child just like his own grandchild.** The more people who genuinely love my child, the better their environment and relationships will be in the future.

### Reflection

As of now, I can accept this current situation. That doesn't mean I condone everything that happened back then. There are valuable lessons there that I won't forget, though they don't need to be constantly brought up.

Learning to forgive doesn't mean forgetting, but choosing not to let the past poison the future.
