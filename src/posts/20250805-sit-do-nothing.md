# Sit and Do nothing

Modern life is very busy. Even after I moved back to my hometown, it still feels very busy. (I can't imagine if I were still in Jakarta, which has become even more chaotic nowadays.)

Working, taking care of my daughter, trying to learn things for personal or career gain, and fitting into society—it has no end.

Today I found this beautifully simple web app: [https://sit.sonnet.io/](https://sit.sonnet.io/)

It acts like a timer—a simple timer that plays a sound when a certain amount of time has passed. During that time, you just sit and do nothing.

No meditation, no obligation to focus on breath, no phone, nothing.

You can daydream if you want, but just sit and stay still.

The first time I tried it, I set it to 1 minute. It felt so long and calm.

Whenever you have time, please try it (with or without this app). Spend your time doing nothing and just stay still. You will find something that you haven't felt in a long time: **yourself**.

It may not work for everybody, but it works for me, so I'm sharing it so you can try it too and see if it's useful for you.ot to let the past poison the future.
