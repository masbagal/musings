# Update: AI Exercise Plan

It's the update from [previously written post](https://notes.dimitrijagal.com/posts/20250608-excerciseplan/).

Short report of the result: **It didn't work**.

## Week 1

For context, I can only do these exercises in the morning when my daughter and wife are still sleeping. Once they wake up, the day gets busy. Doing this in the evening is also difficult because that's when I tag in with my wife to take care of our daughter while she gets some mini rest or tackles her backlog of chores. I could do the workout instead, but she needs that time to give herself a break away from our daughter.

The routine starts with 3 minutes of jumping jacks. Oh boy, my calves cramped so hard on the first day. I couldn't manage 3 minutes nonstop. At first I could do 1 minute straight, but then my calves would hurt too much.

For the dumbbell exercises, the prescribed numbers were too low so I increased them. Instead of only 8 dumbbell chest presses, I did 25. This applied to other exercises because I knew I could do more.

Everything was somewhat okay for the first week. Jumping jacks were the only problem, but I pushed through.

## Week 2

My calves hurt like hell. Walking became painful. There were days when I skipped the exercises because I didn't want to hurt myself more and burden my wife. We don't have any house help, so managing energy and health is crucial in our daily life.

Things also got rough at night. Our daughter cried a lot because she's teething. I couldn't wake up early enough to exercise, or when I could, I didn't have enough energy throughout the day.

## Week 3

The pain became more excruciating and didn't heal as fast as I thought it would. I was overwhelmed with pain and guilt. I couldn't fulfill my commitment to exercise diligently, yet if I forced myself to do it, I wouldn't be doing my fair share of dad duties. It was guilt on both sides. I blamed myself for being too weak to handle these injuries and for not being able to manage my family responsibilities.

Forearms are getting sore as well, and it persists throughout the week (and onwards). Might be related to lack of rest?

Stressed out, I only managed 2 days of exercise this week.

## Week 4

I decided to drop the schedule.

## Moving Forward

I decided that I should still exercise, but it doesn't have to be as strict as the original plan. I would do a morning jog when I wake up early enough or do some light dumbbell exercises when it's almost time for my daughter to wake up. There are days when I do nothing, or I use the time for something else like learning to draw or code.

Maybe I am weak. Maybe I'm not consistent enough. I'll accept that and push through with the time and energy that I have.

Having a baby is tough, and I shouldn't compare myself to others because they might have more free time. There will come a time when I can manage these routines, and I should just focus on the present for now.

Yeah, sorry for this rant, but I hope you can also find understanding for yourself that sometimes things don't work out well even when you put a lot of effort into them. **I learned that rigid schedules don't work for my current life phase, and that's okay**. The time will come if you persevere.

You don't need to make a bonfire every day, lighting a candle is enough.
