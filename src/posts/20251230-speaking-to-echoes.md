# Speaking to Echoes

A few days ago was my late dad's birthday. I made him a cup of _Kapal Api_ coffee and placed it next to a lit candle.

Sitting in front of that coffee table, I started praying for him to rest peacefully. But apparently that prayer turned into a one-sided conversation.

I started complaining. Why is person A so worthless? Why does person B act like that? How can they all be such assholes, Dad? Now I'm confused about this thing, what should I do? I want to know your perspectives. Will you scold me when I said those things or will you validate some of them while sharing your past?

And all the complaints, questions, and grievances came out accompanied by tears.

We should have reached the point where you and I could discuss things openly, discuss as grown men beyond the boundary of father and child. Trying to understand each other's thoughts and learn from experience.

But the reality is you are gone and all my monologues just echo faintly in the living room.
